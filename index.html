		<h5>And It Starts!</h5>
		<p><p>Auto-bot-attacking Twitter feeds. Isn't that something people are supposed to get arrested for? At least it sounds like it should be! But, apparently not, because this is the first lab task I am instructed to do within my first hour of my first day at developer boot camp. 6 days a week, 10 hours each day, for the next 4 months. Does that sound like a job? That's probably because it is. A job and a half, actually. For 60 hours each week, I'm going to be put through the tech ringer, have my mind stretched, put to the test, and supposedly emerge 120 days later as a full-stack software developing butterfly. At least, this is my hope. It's been a while since I was this excited about something like I am today, starting my training! In the process of living, I find that my life has largely been one big "catch up," constantly one step behind where I need to be, both literally and figuratively. By any other means, second best, I feel, would lend itself as a better description of who I was. Something needed to change, and fast. Fast forward to present; I am presented with an opportunity to fully immerse myself in learning a new skill...a new skill that will propel me into the future. A new skill that will allow me to explore the infinite possibilities of pure creation and challenges. A new skill that is, by definition, "future-proof!" ...because with it, I will always be writing that future! Today I start gaining the ability to more efficiently communicate with one of my old friends...that hunk of silicon and wire that has, until now, lent itself more as a fun tool than a stepping stone into the forefront of technology. I am going to learn how to communicate in a new language...an unspeakable language. A language of zeros and ones, pluses and minuses, yeses and nos. I am going to voluntarily become a tech geek. I am going to learn how to develop code. But, more importantly, I am going to learn how to develop myself. Develop myself into a better, well-rounded person. Develop my curiosity for the mysticism that is programming. Develop myself into someone who takes life by the horns and refuses to go down without a fight. Because, like software, life is binary as well. Binary oppositions, highs and lows, haves and have-nots. I refuse to get left behind. I refuse to look back on my life when I'm old wishing I had done more to make something of myself. I refuse to be a have-not. My time is now and I choose "Yes." So bring it on. I am eager and waiting!<p/></p>

		<h5>Gitting It?</h5>
		<p><p>Yesterday, we were introduced to an application called Git. After a morning spent liberating the imprisioned Twitter API from its bleak pythonic confines in an effort to troll the web,* our afternoon shenanigans were sure to be a walk in the park! But, alas, as we started delving deeper into our exercise, its diff-erence was made clear. Stage, Commit, Push, Pull? Wait, don't Push yet. First we need to Clone. Merge? Fork? What the heck? Can't we just press "Save?" Oh, if it were only that simple. This wasn't your grandma's refrigerator notepad. Collaboration, we would soon find out, is the key to successful developing and our ticket to a bug-free code. Git would get us there. And like any good cliche will tell you, two heads are always better than one. After lunch, we could have probably had ten heads and still been lost. The whole group was readily confused...which I further learned makes up about 50% of a developer's time...along with 10% trance-like states of pure coding bliss, 30% caffeine, and 10% cat jokes. All day we may as well have been talked to in Greek...a language I know nothing about. But, through trial and error, and clues and application, I picked up on bits and pieces, whetting my appetite and encouraging me to move forward. This method, I think, will prove to be my metaphorical Rosetta Stone. As the afternoon rolled along, I found myself running through the moves with greater ease than before and a pseudo tech-muscle-memory presented itself allowing my first fleeting glimpse of that bliss. A Developer's High is what they call it. 9 hours and 30 minutes of my day I spent in confusion, but that last 30 minutes of "I get it now!" sure did make it all worth it! Now, let's just hope I remember it too!<p/><p>*This blog does not condone the use of illegal activities or mayhem, and at no time shall the reader assume vague details promote or deduce a presence of them.** <br/> **Twitter's lawyers made me write this.<p/></p>

		<h5>Squeezed By Python</h5>
		<p><p>Today was our first full day of learning what we merely played with yesterday. Recess is over. This is our trial by fire...or, more like baptizm by it. Can't figure something out? Then do something about it until you can! There is no turning back now. We are fully committed to becoming coding gods. (Wait...committed, or committed?) ...And, yet, with less than 48 hours into class, I feel like we've been doing this for a lot longer! I guess that makes sense, though. With the accelerated immersion we've so dutifully taken upon ourselves, I remind myself every three hours that pass equate to a full week of a collegiate classes. But college classes are for sissies. This is the big leagues. We are at the adult table now.<p/><p>8am greeted us with an introduction to strings, arrays, variables, and Booleans. That math I thought I would most definitely leave in high school has just come back to haunt me. Why can't "x" just realize it will never equal the greatness of other integers? And why is it always so secretive?! Just say what you want to be, already! After lecture, we manned our battle stations to begin the first lab of the day. Funny...what was slightly foreign to me yesterday seemed to translate with more ease today. Cmd? Open. Notebooks? Set. Git? Cloned. Python?  -?-  ahem...Python?! *crickets* Okay, so maybe I was a little too cocky about my mad coding skills. == True. I won't be tomorrow. == False.<p/><p>If/Else statements followed lunch, and with them we quickly realized how Python could be less of a mashup of jibberish and more of a great tool...through the ever-so-sophisticated learning tool of video game development! We were tasked with building a dice game! After collaborating to discuss rules and objectives, we split into pairs to begin development. It is at this point I would like to note that there is a guy in camp who was probably, if not most-definitely coding in the womb. He knows it all. In fact, he could probably teach this class. This is child's play to him. In a moment of curious and awesome wonder, as I shielded my eyes from the blinding emination of 1s and 0s coming from his coding being, I asked him why he was even taking the class. He responded, "For the collaborative element." All I can say is "Thank goodness for that," because that source sensai was now collaborating with me...as my project partner. I am in boot camp right now. But in the next two hours, I upgraded to Marine Op and Ranger Training all-in-one! If ever there was a time when I felt so empowered, yet helpless at the same time, it was then. That was coding on crack! I learned so much from him! Loops, variables, random integers, debugging...and it all came together in one beautifully written, albeit visually ugly Unicode game. We kicked butt! This thing was slick! My first piece of useful code in less than 2 days. "X" was definitely equalling awesome at that moment. I was on a major high! ...and those two hours flew by! Such a cool feeling! I can't wait to do another one!<p/><p>Remember how I said everything is Binary? Too bad I was just on Cloud Nine. Our next Lab was coming up and, in retrospect, I should have probably taken a break after writing the game. Despite my high, my brain was fried from extreme over-thinking, and I quickly realized this when I found myself re-reading the first lab question 20 times and still not getting it. How did that happen?! I was just on fire?! Surly I could handle five more questions! Nope! The next two hours, unlike the last two, dragged, and with each new failed trial and error I tested, my excitement and brain quickly faded. I was checking out. Not to be undone by a few lines of code, I desparately turned to my friend Google in a last ditch effort to redeem my might. Fate wouldn't have it and at 5:30, SCRUM was called...less than half way through my final lab. Our SCRUM is a real-world simulation of a meeting with the same name in which developers meet after a long day to discuss their thoughts and progress from their individual or group projects. After meeting to discuss our day and collaborations, I meekly walked back to my computer, deflated by the pending doom waiting my return...a snake so vicious and conniving, it's muscular grasp seized me from afar. For the next two hours, I fought tooth and nail to figure out how to reorder lists, verify email inputs, and twist Booleans. But I fought hard. I would not let this snake squeeze the life out of me. I showed it human muscle. And I won...two hours later. As I packed up and walked to my car, brain dead and tired, I found myself eager for tomorrow. Despite the emotional roller coaster that was my day, I compare it akin to a good workout. I leave the gym sore but feeling good. Well, today, my brain got one hell of a workout...but that guy is itching for more! After all, I'm in this to the end...the just-fired spark of a human coding machine!<p/></p>

		<h5>A Can Of Raid</h5>
		<p><p>"Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the iterable iterable." You may read that again if you would like. I did...multiple times, actually. Prior to continuing here, I should probably mention something. Last night, when I left the lab, claiming to have "gotten" it, I was not entirely accurate. I got it so much as the way a wad of chewing gum would get a leaky dam to hold. It was a temporary fix to an infinitely greater problem (But I'm definitely counting my little victories here...at least I was dry again!). After getting home, that sticky gum started to leak in my mind after I ran the code through my .function(brain). There were so many bugs and vulnerabilities to my logic. So, in an effort to redeem myself, I entered the lab this morning with a rested and fresh look at my intimate friend, Problem Number 5 from Lab 4: How to confirm a valid email address in Python. It sounds easy enough, right? After all, we enter our emails into forms everyday, none the wiser about whether it is accurate or not. It just works. But let me tell you, behind the scenes, deep underneath the pretty facade of any website or software, there is an army of human-developed code that needs to run flawlessly and simulate human intelligence pertaining to simple functions we take for granted. Here in-lies my problem. How to write that. The quote above is actually the definition of what a str.join() function does. Still not making sense? Yeah...for me neither. I needed to figure out how to produce an "Invalid" message for an email address outside of "valid" form; ".com" in the wrong place, multiple "@"s, not actually containing an "@," containing spaces, or starting with a number. In a "grasping at straws" attempt to solve my problem, I read through each Python function definition in the directory with a hope that one would tell me what I was looking for...the ability to confirm if the ".com" or ".org" or ".io" or ".cc" or any other suffix was at the end of the address and not in the middle. None did. 2 hours later. Same place. Enter my friendly neighborhood coding guru, my lab partner from yesterday. I should let you know that I am about 22 hours into my training at this point. I have no idea what I can or can't do pertaining to syntax (grammar) or permissions (what I can actually do with the data I have). My lab partner, lets call him Jim for anonymity sake, suggests I look at the .find() function and analyze how the "." in the suffix relates to the "@" in the address. In other words, does it come before or after? *Light Bulb!* When a Python string (the email address in this case) evaluates itself, it breaks each character into an ordered number, or index, list (i.e. [0,1,2,3,4...etc]). The .find() function allowed me to find that "." and find that "@," subtract the number of the former from the number of the later, and see if that difference was greater than or equal to 1. If that was TRUE, the "." would always fall after the "@." So incredibly simple! ...now that I know it! But I do get it. Even though I'm only into my third day, all of these problems I've run into are actually learning experiences. ...and they will stick with me! I went back to our older labs later in the morning and looked at the problems I was stuck on before. They seem so easy to me now and I re-did them in my mind with little effort! This is very refreshing and, also, inspiring. If I can do this now, imagine where I will be in three months!<p/><p>Lunch breaks are getting easier also. On Monday, 30 minutes only lasted 15, relatively. Today, I think we are up to 20, and I returned with time to spare. Meeting in the "luxury suite," our group collaborated to write a Python game that mimicked a very popular group game. For legal purposes, I've been told not to name it here, but I'll give you a hint: It rhymes with "Schmapples to Schmapples." This was a fun session because all of our skills and expertise levels combined for the first time. Where one person did not know something, another could interject, and what would have been hard as an individual project now became easy. The six of us ensured each person had a grasp of the task at hand and didn't move forward until we all did. I can definitely see how SCRUM and collaboration work well if this is any indication of the "real world." Starting out, I was a bit shaky on terms, but as the code flowed, I became a lot more comfortable. It's like seeing someone you think you know from afar...at a distance, one may doubt their identity, but as that person gets closer, certainty is eminent.<p/><p>If I have noticed one thing about my personal development over the past few days, it is this; I have gone through so many highs and lows and certainties and doubts, but with each fallback, I find I emerge one step ahead of where I was before. I'll tell you also, that may change tomorrow when I get into my next big bind, but for now I'm good. I have a feeling this will be the norm for the next few weeks as I slowly get a grasp on this new information. There are people here with all different knowledge bases, and each will learn at his own level and speed...myself included. But, I can do this. That is reassuring to me, right now, as I write this. Life is good.<p/></p>
